Supermarket Simulation
======================

The provided Racket code is a part of a simulation project that models the flow
of customers in a supermarket with multiple counters. The project involves the
definition of data structures, such as the counter structure, and the implementation
of functions to update and simulate the behavior of these counters.

Here is a brief overview of the main components and functionality:
Counter Structure:
The counter structure represents a checkout counter in the supermarket and includes
fields for the counter's index, total time (tt), exit time (et), and a queue of
customers.
Helper Functions:
Functions like empty-counter, need-help, update, tt+, et+, add-to-counter,
best-minimum, minimum-for-all, min-tt, min-et, and remove-first-from-counter are
defined to manipulate and update counters based on various operations (e.g., adding
customers, updating times, finding minimum values).
Simulation Function (serve):
The serve function simulates the flow of customers and processes different types of
requests, including:
Adding a person to a counter.
Delaying a counter.
Removing the first person from a counter.
Ensuring that the average total time is below a specified threshold.
The simulation manages two types of counters: fast-counters (with a limit on the
number of items) and slow-counters (without restrictions on items). It iteratively
processes a list of requests and updates the counters accordingly.

Note: The project is incomplete.

In summary, the project aims to create a simulation of a supermarket checkout system
where different types of requests influence the behavior of checkout counters.
The simulation considers both fast and slow counters, and the main goal is to manage
the flow of customers efficiently.
